# LanguageBuddy Crowdsourcing Platform for Language Translations

Implementation includes experiment modes that innovates upon language translation crowdsourcing methodologies,
Where the creation of custom datasets has been automated thru custom made python scripts that make use of the [Flores Dataset](https://github.com/facebookresearch/flores?fbclid=IwAR0WzmQ-E64cstn1zmYBZJbGzNMXuK87hr_RatfAxle6gNbvVPJWDTtLJ6Y).

  **LingoTurk** is an open-source, freely available crowdsourcing
  client/server system aimed primarily at psycholinguistic
  experimentation where custom and specialized user interfaces are
  required but not supported by popular crowdsourcing task management
  platforms.
  
  LingoTurk enables user-friendly local hosting of
  experiments as well as condition management and participant
  exclusion. It is compatible with Amazon Mechanical Turk and Prolific
  Academic.  New experiments can easily be set up via the Play
  Framework and the LingoTurk API, while multiple experiments can be
  managed from a single system.
  
  - Easy to use
  - Based on the [Play Framework](https://www.playframework.com/)
  - Back-end is written in Java
  - Completly typesave (Typesave HTTP Router and Scala-based Templates)
  - (*Almost*) no need to use the Mechanical Turk API
  - Can easily be modified and extended
